# Lab03

Implement a C program that takes two filename as command-line arguments and 
concatenates the contents of the second file to the first file.  The program should 
check if the two filenames provided as command-line arguments are the same and 
print an error message in such a case. After the program executes successfully, the 
first file should now contain it's original content and the contents of the second file. 
The second file should be unchanged. Here is an example: 

# getting started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push

1.gcc - GNU Compiler Collection
2.Text editor

# installing 

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running

1.open the text editor
2.create a c programming file
3.save the file with .c extension.

# running the tests

functionality of the program: 

The contents of one file is appended to the other file.

To test the program follow the below commands:
